# poprox jupyter playground

welcome friends! this is our space to play around with python and jupyter notebooks. feel free to create a new notebook. if you don't have any ideas what to do within one yet, i hope to inspire some with the research blog! files you create will remain local to your browser, while any files that i commit to the repo will show up for everyone. later on we'll have a shared server running jupyterlab that will have greater compute resources, better software compatibility, and privacy - it'll be great for research, play and collaboration!
