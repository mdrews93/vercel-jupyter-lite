# poprox jupyter playground

welcome friends of poprox! this is our space to play around with python and jupyter notebooks. be mindful that everything here is publicly available. later on we'll have a shared server running jupyterlab that will have greater compute resources, better software compatibility, and privacy - it'll be great for research, play and collaboration!
